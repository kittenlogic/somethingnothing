        <img class="img-fat" src="img/homeland-books.png" />
        <h5>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h5>
        <p>In February 2012, the Department of Homeland Security was forced to release a document previously requested – and denied – via the Freedom of Information Act containing a list of hundreds of keywords regularly queried for the purpose of
          monitoring suspicious activity on social networking sites <a href="http://epic.org/foia/epic-v-dhs-media-monitoring/" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="http://epic.org/foia/epic-v-dhs-media-monitoring/Analyst-Desktop-Binder-REDACTED.pdf"
            target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="http://epic.org/foia/epic-v-dhs-media-monitoring/EPIC-FOIA-DHS-Media-Monitoring-12-2012.pdf" target="_blank">[3]</a>. Subsequent news headlines about this disclosure warned that the list contained
          "hundreds of words you shouldn't use online if you don't want to end up on an FBI watch list" <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150281/REVEALED-Hundreds-words-avoid-using-online-dont-want-government-spying-you.html"
            target="_blank">[4]</a>.</p>
        <p>In response to this call for "sensible", precautionary self-/censorship, I am proposing to build my own Department of Homeland Security website that monitors and archives the use of these targeted 374 keywords on popular social networking
          sites. The information collected will be made available to the public through homelandsecurityhearts.us as both a 24 hour live stream (phase 1) and in archival form (phase 2). The latter option will include print-on-demand services,
          allowing users to compile data into periodic volumes for any combination of keywords they wish to access.</p>
        <!-- <p>My goal is to build a system that is scalable, using a combination of public and private channels (i.e. using both public API keys and data brokers) for gathering information. I will focus on developing the programming infrastructure to handle mining one of these networks at a time. At a later stage, I hope to expand processing capabilities to both increase the volume of information mined and to include a wider cross-section of relevant social media sites (phase 3).  I am currently working on phases 1 and 2, which will focus exclusively on Twitter.</p> -->
        <h5>MOTIVATION</h5>
        <p>Everyday, we move further into a world where the rights to individual privacy are ceasing to exist; where attempts by those who conscientiously object to the erosion of our civil liberties, both on and offline, are demonized as naïve,
          suspicious or "unpatriotic"; and perhaps most alarming, where we are all now subject to the scrutiny of retroactive policing made possible by an increasing number of "big data" collaborations between governments and corporations <a
            href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-418.html" target="_blank">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/do-you-want-the-government-buying-your-data-from-corporations/275431/" target="_blank">[6]</a>.</p>
        <p>The DHS maintains that they are only monitoring genuine threats and not general dissent (which is arguable <a href="http://www.justiceonline.org/commentary/new-documents-reveal-dhs.html#documents" target="_blank"> [7]</a><a
            href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s1009r.pdf" target="_blank"> [8]</a>), yet it is unclear as to what safeguards are in place to prevent other misinterpretations of "threats" from being taken out of context, as was demonstrated by
          the banning of two British teens from entering the United States for tweeting that they were going to "destroy America" <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/london/think-before-you-tweet-why-two-teenagers-were-refused-entry-to-the-u-s/2802"
            target="_blank">[9]</a>.</p>
        <p>While my project may amount to nothing more than a provocative gesture that may or may not get me into trouble (as one friend noted without hesitation, <em>'You're going to jail'</em>), one thing is certain: we live in a climate of fear,
          where we now openly acknowledge, without irony, that everything we do online is game for a system whose tactics for discerning an actual, immanent threat become increasingly indistinguishable and indefensible from the construction of one.
          homelandsecurityhearts.us is my way of allowing the public to construct their own in-/congruous narratives from this pre-filtered list of keywords that we already unwittingly supply to the watchful eye of government surveillance efforts for
          that very ambiguous purpose.</p>
        <h5>MOCKUP OF PRINT-ON-DEMAND ORDER PAGE</h5><img class="img-fat" src="img/homeland-orderform.png" />
        <!-- <h5>PHASE 1. "LIVE" STREAMING (PUBLIC IN/ACCESSIBILITY)</h5><p>For Phase 1 of the project I will develop a program that mines Twitter using the Twitter Streaming API. The Streaming API allows for a continuous connection that receives tweets in real-time for up to 400 keywords from 5,000 user accounts. In order to obtain the maximum number of queries while complying with the rate limits set by Twitter, I will need to setup a system of multiple Oauth accounts and employ two servers: one to handle requests and store to an SQL database, the other to parse the tweets sent back to the client via a cached version of the website. I will be using the 140dev Twitter Framework free source code library to develop this phase of the project <a href="http://140dev.com/free-twitter-api-source-code-library/" target="_blank">[10]</a>.</p><h5>PHASE 2. ENDLESS ARCHIVE (DATA BROKER "LITE")</h5><p>For Phase 2, I plan to use DataSift.com data broker services (unless I gain access to the Library of Congress’s Twitter archive <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2013/01/update-on-the-twitter-archive-at-the-library-of-congress/" target="_blank">[11]</a>) to mine tweets that are inaccessible through public channels. For Twitter, this means anything older than 7 days ago.  During this phase I will also work with a programmer to develop the methodology for designing print-on-demand options that reflect realtime results and custom keyword combinations.</p><h5>PHASE 3. SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</h5><p>The primary goal of Phase 3 is to diversify and deepen the project goals. I would like the next site I archive to be an image based site, like Flickr. Provided I can secure future sources of funding, I would also like to invite contributors (artists, activists, hackers, curators, academics, theorists, journalists, security analysts, non-/fiction writers, etc) to curate one volume per keyword (374 volumes total) using any combination of available images and texts for that particular keyword. This special collection will also be made available as a free PDF download or hard copy purchase via homelandsecurityhearts.us.</p> -->
