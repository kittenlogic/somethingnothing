        <h5>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h5>
        <p><em>In theory</em> is a program capable of generating an infinite philosophical text based on recursive google search results originated by the phrase, “in theory”. As the program learns about theory, it attempts to reconcile the differences between theory and practice, until all possibile combinations of theory vs/and/or practice are exhausted and/or a new theory about theory and practice is put forth. The mockup below features a prerecorded sample of what to expect from the text itself. I apologize for the poorly synced audio to (scrolling) text. This is only a test.</p>
        <h5>DOCUMENTATION</h5>
        <canvas id="canvas" width="960" height="60">
          This series presents information based in part on theory and conjecture. The producer's purpose is to suggest some possible explanations, but not necessarily the only ones, to the mysteries we will examine. All are reconciled and unified in the theory which we shall now set forth. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is. If something is possible in theory, it should be possible, but often it does not happen in that way. An actual infinity is something which is completed and definite and consists of infinitely many elements, and according to Aristotle, a paradoxical idea, both in theory and in nature. So-called ‘pessimistic meta-inductions’ about theoretical knowledge take many forms and are probably almost as ancient as scepticism itself. They have the basic form: In Theory: Is America becoming less civil? In Theory: Is the Bible a suitable game show subject? In Theory: Can the Catholic Church restore its image? In Theory: How can we lower the rate of military suicides? Students that are in the 8th grade or above, can follow these questions in theory and praxis within the scope of the project, "One Day in the Stone Age". We will consider a range of communities seeking answers to these questions, in theory and in practice, to create and maintain cultures of solidarity. In theory, at the beginning all babies are equal and share the same possibilities for development. Growing up, they are facing different social, cultural and linguistic surroundings. They are losing their openness and thus develop differently. The open human brain becomes restricted by norms and the older a person gets, the more fixed his/her ideas become. One of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is gaining the ability to attribute false belief: that is, to recognize that others can have beliefs about the world that are diverging. In theory, of course, any literature that delves deeply into the human condition will also make the reader a better reader of people. reading people is a key element of successfully navigating the business world. Nevertheless, courses in theory construction are rarely offered in psychology. Instead, opportunities to learn about theory construction will likely come in an informal manner; however, the informal opportunities to learn about theory construction can emerge in formal settings. If only a single equilibrium exists for a given game, this means that, in theory at least, we can always compute the “appropriate” strategy for a given game. For example, Stalking sissies is easy in theory, in fact ideal. That is if you're looking for an admiration from afar--and this is the stuff that I've been preaching. Unfortunately, the scaredy-cat stalker has a little more in common with their plain scary counterparts than they may like to admit. In the case of women and eastern European immigrants, a similar devolution occurred--welcomed as equals in theory, excluded or segregated in practice. This final rejection results in payoffs of zero for both players, so the second player can (in theory) successfully demand $1.99 in the second stage if the first player prefers a penny to nothing. The former enjoyed a two-to-one advantage over the latter among those who spoke, with much of crowd opinion resting with a sizable, aesthetically-driven middle ground -- people who professed support for street reclamation in theory, but just don't like the look of nipple bollards. "The plunging into sexuality in theory and practice," Breuer wrote, "is not to my taste." Breuer objected that Freud had collapsed the complex lives of his patients into one, sweeping theme - sexuality.  I guess it's arguable that there are melodramas without romance - in theory.  Love, in Theory is a practical manual for beginners at and adepts of love, for young and old, for the unrequited and faithful and faithless—which is to say, for us all. Love in Theory and Practice contains a bonus disc that has all thirteen tracks from the album but in acoustic form, titled Baudelaire in Braille. Of course, sexual selection could in theory accommodate either possibility of direct ethnographic evidence that music is indeed involved in human courtship. Dating sites, in theory at least, are for people looking for dates. Shag A Gamer is for people who want to shag. Truth is strange--but this is fiction. "Impregnate" (in reproduction, not manufacturing) means that successful fertilization has already taken place: sperm met with egg and an embryo is developing. That did not happen. There was no impregnation, no pregnancy, and no baby squid.In other words, many people want a Catholic Church that adapts to the times, particularly in matters of gender and sexuality. In theory, if the Roman Catholic Church adapted they could stop the exodus of members. Of course, this is “in theory,” since the Church claims eternal and universal truths, unless a Pope decides to use his powers of infallibility to change these matters not much is going to happen. Surprisingly, whilst everyone agrees with what Catholicism teaches about Hell in theory, many seem not to want to get the implications when the theory is put into practice. The present company is, of course, always excluded; so are our relatives and friends, because they have “their heart in the right place” (they love animals so much, you know). God Damn America and Going to Hell, in theory, are the same thing. Hell in theory just because someone hit your transmission doesn't mean anything, a hit on transmission doesn't make fires, or it shouldn't, a hit on the fuel tank or in the engine, or ammo rack its a different matter. In theory, the dark smoke from the burning oil wells absorbs sunlight and the surrounding air is heated. Hell in theory they'd be able to eat the skin off the bone wouldn't they? I have no trouble with hell in theory, but I get tripped up over the word eternal. my resting place for eternity, in theory, an underground bed of sorts, the sun setting in the sky, teletubbies say goodbye, the ground is soggy, my dead father buried next door, weeds reclaim the space,  I love how green and healthy it is, and my father is a hard-core biker-commuter – from park slope to chelsea every day. I’m very pro bike in theory. I wish it was an option for me. Ontological discontinuity in theory change seems to give us grounds not for mere agnosticism but for the positive belief that many central theoretical terms of our best contemporary science will be regarded as non-referring by future science. But at least in theory you could find a finite number of elements to your language which you explain with your theory of reference or just assume they have a reference, and then you could show how you could build infinitely many sentences out of these things.  In theory, an indefinite sentence could be very short, or it could be a life sentence if no decision is made after sentencing to lift the term. Death sentences in Iran are, in theory, legal for eight different crimes: armed robbery, treason, murder, drug trafficking, rape, pedophilia, sodomy, kidnapping, and terrorism. In theory, going through the exercises of reading everyone else's sentences, then seeing the pattern over and over again should help you get better at the pattern itself. Sentencing circles in theory should lead to lower recidivism rates among offenders who go through them. In this fashion, even Kuhn’s conjecture about the lack of falsification in theory testing becomes rationally accountable: statements (or inferences among statements) may be disproven and still leave the theory core intact.
