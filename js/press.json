      "author": "Johanna Hedva",
      "date": "September 9 2020",
      "text": "<p>Excerpt: JH: As a writer myself, I‚Äôm always fascinated with the language part of working with programming languages ‚Äî not only that they follow certain grammar rules, but that there are poetic possibilities, narrative possibilities. Can you speak a little about how the many uses of language functioned in your project? How did you conceptualize that?</p><p> EM: Within the context of unsupervised machine learning for text-generation, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the difference between using machine learning for poetics vs. prediction. And how to best use ML language-generating bots as tools for world-building, mirroring, and self-reflection.</p><p> So far, my work with AI is focused on using private (one-to-one) conversational chatbots as a strategy for experimenting with machine-learning models trained on carefully curated content that explores pleasure, reflects difference, and accounts for the nuances of small, marginalized, or intentional communities‚Äîtheir identities, lexicons, vernaculars, sexualities, and sub/cultures.</p><p> I like private chatbots because I think they elicit a very different type of interaction than, say, a public Twitter bot. The conditions inherent in private (one-to-one) chat hold the potential to engender an intimate and self-reflexive experience much more easily than the conditions set up by a public (one-to-many) chat, where the inclination to perform habitual tasks of information querying/retrieval or to test the bots limits (e.g. harassment) are more common. When you know no one is watching or that you are your only audience, the dynamic changes, the expectations change, the questions change. As a result, the interactions tend to be more confessional, more introspective, more vulnerable. <a href='https://medium.com/processing-foundation/what-can-machine-learning-teach-us-about-ourselves-65b268431890' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>[Read more...]</a></p>",

      "text": "<p>Excerpt: An October 2019 news item about Amazon warehouse workers said they were commanded to continue their shifts after a coworker died on the job.¬≥ The implication was that the life of workers doesn‚Äôt matter. Only their labor does. Jeff Bezos‚Äôs first name for Amazon was Cadabra, like a spell, but he changed it when people on the phone heard it as ‚Äúcadaver.‚Äù4 The anecdote is horrifically apt.</p><p>Amazon is a totalizing system that has changed how we buy everything from books to groceries. In 2018 it announced a plan to enter the health care industry. The corporation seems to have its fingers in almost every sector. It‚Äôs no surprise, then, that Amazon‚Äôs negative effects are many. [...]</p><p>The Future of Work (2016), a zine that is part of a larger, ongoing project by the collective Anxious to Make (Liat Berdugo and Emily Martinez), aggregates more than one hundred results from a survey asking participants about the sharing economy and gig labor. Many respondents were contract workers found on MTurk, where surveys are a common form of work. Anxious to Make‚Äôs survey questions are equally serious and playful. ‚ÄúDo you ever feel like algorithms are your boss?‚Äù asks one. The zine paints an absurdist, ambivalent picture of the present. Some workers feel tenuous and uncertain about the gig economy while others embrace it.</p>",

Humanity is slowly but surely reaching the point of no return, a point of irreversible environmental damage, a point of mass extinction, widespread catastrophe and a step toward uninhabitability. This disaster is a human-made one, a result of a variety of factors including corrupt governance in the western world, dystopic late-stage capitalism, historic colonialism and seemingly endless war. This program is concerned with this current period of human activity, finding a group of artists asking where we can go from here, using views from the past, present and future. When the end seems to be looming and those who can do something about it refuse, what else is there to do but to sit back and watch it happen?</p><p>About Vector: Vector Festival is a participatory and community-oriented initiative dedicated to showcasing digital games and creative media practices. Presenting works across a dynamic range of exhibitions, screenings, performances, lectures, and workshops, Vector acts as a critical bridge between emergent digital platforms and new media art practice.

      "text": "<p>When Celeste Network invited me to curate the first edition of a new prize dedicated to photography and video, it was natural for me to identify as a dominant theme ‚Äòarchive fever‚Äô and contemporary photography‚Äôs interest in history and the construction of collective memory. Characterizing the prize with a combination of theme and specific language, enhances the contest compared with others, because it serves the dual purpose of investigating the current artistic scene, as well as reflecting on new expressive possibilities in contemporary photography and video.</p><p>We know that the memory industry is in its own way forgetful; collective memory today is more and more instantaneous, short-lived, at times finding it hard even to remember what has just passed. We are all veterans of the recent collapse of utopias and great ideological narratives, immersed in an endless and forgetful present driven by our media age. We live in this timeless condition, inventing paradoxically new technologies to ‚Äòstore‚Äô memories, to build networks of shared memory, to eternalize and store every bit of experience, transforming all this human material in new forms of storytelling: open stories in the process of being written, made not to reach a definitive historicization. Art reacts to this unusual form of phenomenology by activating ‚Äòcounter-memory‚Äô practices and inventing new devices of storytelling through the exploration and potential inherent in archives.</p><p>Archives have become readymades of time. Through archival documents we perceive the relationship between time and history, reality and representation, between an event and its future. In capturing the spark of time filed in an image, a photograph or a video, we are able to fix the past in an eternal, suspended present as well as offer a glimpse of a possible future.</p><p>This reflection on the active nature of time is what makes photography and video so relevant today. Artists that explore the use of archives and the production of collective memory are asking themselves what are photographic or film images able to remember or forget, and for whom or for what purpose. In this way, artists rethink their authority over the technology of memory and reflect on the authorship of images in a season in which new technologies have disrupted their historical significance.</p><p>368 projects were submitted to ‚Äòbeyondmemory‚Äô, showing just how urgent and meaningful the phenomenon of ‚Äòarchive fever‚Äô is in our culture today. The 10 finalists, selected by members of the jury, Giovanna Calvenzi, Daniele De Luigi and George Tatge, are representative of different lines of research on the subject and forms which photography and video practice have taken compared with other languages such as new media.</p><p>An interesting phenomenon which emerges from this selection is the inter-relationship between still-image photography and moving-image video or film, ending once and for all any limit between the two languages. Of the 10 finalist projects, 3 are photographic projects by Claudio Gobbi, Marta Primavera and Greg Sand; 6 are video projects by Patrizia Bonardi, Dave Farnham, Emily Martinez, Kavit Mody, Caterina Pecchioli and Enrique Ramirez; and 1 project is by Fotoromanzo Italiano, dedicated to the now obsolete ‚Äòpicture story‚Äô device revisited as a hybrid of different languages.</p><p>Walter Benjamin wrote that the historical content index in images shows that they are understood only at particular times in their history. In the works of Kavit Mody, Marta Primavera and Caterina Pecchioli the past is \"observed with new eyes,\" described in an open, dynamic time horizon regarding today‚Äôs issues, finally revealing it‚Äôs hidden character of differing intelligibilities in a wider process of construction of memory. Especially in Mody‚Äôs and Pecchioli‚Äôs work the narration of history ‚Äì in Mody the tragic nuclear explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in Pecchioli the popular figure of a person considered ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô in the memory of her fellow citizens  - isn‚Äôt left only to the image, but is supported by word and narrative voices of those who recount events through the practice of remembrance. In Primavera‚Äôs work it is the legacy of visual cultural history which needs to be investigated, begging the question: how do images of the past affect the creation of the future?</p><p>Being contemporary in our century and ‚Äònow‚Äô, but also in the figures, texts and documents of the past, characterizes the research of Fotoromanzo Italiano and Claudio Gobbi. The history of a territory and nation, the cultural anthropology of landscape, the political reflection on the state of today and the nature of photography in general, are interwoven into forms of counter-narrative realities which meditate on the present having explored the ruins of history.</p><p>The conflictual character of the present, situated between the ‚Äònot yet‚Äô of the future and the ‚Äòno more‚Äô of the past, is sublimated in the works of Enrique Ramirez, Greg Sand and Dave Farnham. The point of departure for all of them is autobiographical memory and personal experience. In Ramirez‚Äôs work it is inexorably intertwined with the political history of his country Chile and with collective repression, while Sand‚Äôs work becomes a place of exploration and verification of identity over time through the genre of photographic portraiture. In Farnham‚Äôs work the presence of collective memory is shifted into sport and its tele-vision: sport is a cathartic moment of collective social expression of instincts, significant as it enables understanding of the dynamic relationship between individuals and their historical identity.</p><p>Even in Patrizia Bonardi‚Äôs video individual memory is the fulcrum of an experience of self through time. Her search for a literal fusion with earth denotes the current need to find in nature‚Äôs memory a rapprochement with what is human and a distancing from what is artificial. Emily Martinez‚Äôs reflection is diametrically opposed to Bonardi‚Äôs, she observes in the post-human character of our time, the ways in which network media build our memory processes. In Martinez‚Äôs collage of heteroclite, digital images, the artist questions the perception and narration of history, how new technologies incarnate our collective memory, and our ability to process cognitive and emotional responses.</p>",

Then there's the subject matter of several of the works, which appropriate Christian iconography for subversive ends.

Their little grab bag of a show, consisting of not quite four dozen pieces of varying sizes and in various media, lives up to its pull-you-in title.</p><p>The rack card for the show describes Balbone and Martinez's methodology as \"primarily based upon recycling trash and found imagery,\" and they have assembled a veritable treasure-trove of quirky odds and ends. Among the components of their installation are pieces that play on religious iconography, with an irreverent twist ‚Äî a Last Supper in which the participants have all been affixed with oversized doll eyes, for instance, or a pairing of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid couched among words that add up to a paranoid diatribe. An advertising placard such as you might find in a store or restaurant includes the declaration \"WISHES WON'T DO DISHES\" as well as the politically incorrect addendum \"BUT MEXICANS WILL.\"</p><p>Balbone and Martinez are playing with matters of context and interpretation, and the information overload they supply is initially exhilarating. Then a sort of aesthetic delirium sets in, and you may find yourself ready for another contrast, which is readily supplied in the center's Project Room. [. . .]</p>",

      "text": "<p>Since meeting more than 10 years ago at Florida International University, Michael Balbone and Emily Martinez have collaborated on many artworks and projects as Balbone Martinez, including a sparkling version of the Wendy‚Äôs girl for a contest the burger chain held in 2008. The challenge was to re-create Wendy with a Miami feel.</p><p>‚ÄúI am a vegetarian but I told everyone I would eat a Baconator if we won the $25,000 grand prize from the Wendy‚Äôs Great Taste Tour,‚Äù Martinez recalls. ‚ÄúWe did not win, but our piece lives inside Wendy‚Äôs corporate headquarters. ‚Ä¶ I confess to fantasizing about important board meetings being conducted in the presence of our sequined, glittery version of the redheaded goddess of hamburgers.‚Äù</p><p>That contrast is typical of the work of Balbone Martinez, whose exhibition Speaking in Parables Will Get You Nowhere With This Crowd is on display at the Art and Culture Center of Hollywood through May 23.</p><p>In their work, the pair uses old picture frames with images ‚Äî of poorly rendered seascapes and the like ‚Äî that typically decorate the homes of what Balbone says people in the fine art world call the ‚Äúhoi polloi.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI personally do not mean that in any derogatory way,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúThese images have power that is often overlooked and ignored. We are trying to re-instate the power of the images.‚Äù</p><p>Take ‚ÄúTed Haggard,‚Äù their digital print named for the former evangelical preacher who resigned after admitting that he solicited a male prostitute for sex and meth. The image depicts an autumn landscape typically seen on cheesy inspirational posters but reads, ‚ÄúEven when I was high on Tina [street slang for crystal meth], bent over the massage table, I knew I was filled with Christ‚Äôs love.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúMr. Haggard is very anti-gay in his preachings,‚Äù Balbone explains. ‚ÄúThe piece wrestles with Christ‚Äôs forgiveness vs. the hypocrisy of humanity.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúCosta Rica Is Lovely But ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù is an old wooden photo plaque that contains a drawing of a table heaped with cocaine and these words: ‚ÄúDue to the fact that your country made a recent flex of drug control muscle after years of atrophy, my country is flooded with cheap cocaine looking for a home.‚Äù Balbone says the piece was based on a conversation he had with a man from Costa Rica, a stop on the smuggling route from Colombia to the United States.</p><p>In ‚ÄúSeaside Fringe,‚Äù Balbone added fringe to a seaside painting he believes is similar to those hanging above couches in thousands of homes. ‚ÄúThe fringe is a standard in any dance recital costume and just seemed totally opposite the painting,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just found them both so interesting, so I combined them.‚Äù Speaking in Parables Will Get You Nowhere With This Crowd also contains about two dozen reflections of what Balbone calls ‚Äúa hyperexaggerated America.‚Äù ‚ÄúI like the idea of the parable because it implies a hidden meaning,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe story is never to be taken at face value. We use a lot of bright, happy, candy colors to disguise some rather dark subject matter.‚Äù</p><p>Martinez says the method for connecting seemingly disparate topics stems from ‚Äútrying to understand things from an infinitely interconnected view of the universe.‚Äù</p><p>While working on this show, she strongly considered something political scientist Walter Truett Anderson once said about democracy: ‚ÄúThe dilemma is that, while governance issues grow ever more complex and information more copious, the systems of mass communication make it ever more possible for political operators (left, right and center) to distort this complexity ‚Äî to reduce it down to simple stories most people can understand without too much trouble, and can believe as long as they don‚Äôt take in too much information. We move every day into a world that makes greater demands on the intelligence of citizens, while the energies of our communications are focused directly on the creation and dissemination of idiotic stories about what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù</p>",
