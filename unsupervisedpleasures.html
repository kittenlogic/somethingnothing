        <h5>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h5>
        <p><strong>Unsupervised Pleasures</strong> is a DIY community library and practice space using queer methodologies, glitch feminism, decolonial and other non-normative frameworks to create datasets, machine learning models, bots, publications, and art with AI. Stewarded by myself and <a href="https://sarahciston.github.io/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Ciston</a>.</p>

        <h5>TLDR; A BRIEF HISTORY</h5>
        <p><strong>Unsupervised Pleasures</strong> started as a blog to document some of my research and experiments with machine learning. It emerged as an offshoot of my <a href="https://medium.com/processing-foundation/what-can-machine-learning-teach-us-about-ourselves-65b268431890" class="link-fancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ML5.js fellowship</a> in 2020, during which I learned how to prep training data and work with machine learning models such as GPT-2, a language model created by OpenAI.</p>

        <p>A goal of my research was to study some of the bias inherent to GPT-2, which I decided to explore by “fine tuning” the model with small datasets and then writing strategic prompts to generate texts (GPT-2) and images (VQGan+Clip) that revealed some of the latent qualities and "failures" of the GPT-X models. Some of the custom models I made include the works of Audre Lorde, Spinoza and an updated model of QueerAI (v2).</p>

        <p>As this work evolved, I felt a strong desire to meet other people interested in working with AI who were also thinking about how to "infect" these large language models (GPT-X) with our own datasets. I also wanted to develop a deeper practice for how to bring queer, intersectional, and decolonial methodologies into this work and everyday life.</p>

        <p>For our first dataset collection, Sarah and I are curating materials that are focused on an ethics of care and mutual aid, and philosophies deeply rooted in love and reciprocity. There will be more to come.</p>
