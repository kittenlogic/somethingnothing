        <p>Emily Martinez is a queer Latinx, 1st generation Cuban immigrant/refugee, raised by Miami, now living in Los Angeles. She is a new media artist, developer, digital strategist, and serial collaborator who believes in the tactical misuse of technology. Her most recent works explore new economies and queer technologies. Long-term projects/departures/returns explore collective trauma, archetypal roles, and post-apocalyptic narratives.

        <br/><br/>
        When Emily is not making art, she works and volunteers with <a href="https://colorcoded.la/" target="_blank">Color&lt;Coded&gt;</a>, a POC tech and pedagogy collective in Los Angeles that centers historically-excluded people in the co-teaching, co-creation, and co-ownership of new technologies.

        <br/><br/>
        Emilyâ€™s art and research has been published in Art in America, Media-N, Leonardo Journal (MIT Press), Temporary Art Review, and Filmmaker Magazine. Her work has been exhibited in over 60+ venues internationally, including Drugo More (Rijeka, Croatia), Transmediale (Berlin, DE), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco), MoMA PS1 (New York), V2_Lab for the Unstable Media (Rotterdam, NL), The Luminary (St. Louis), The Institute of Network Cultures (Amsterdam, NL), The Wrong Biennale, and Telematic (San Francisco).</p>
